# Use Google Translate Extension with an American accent!

This browser extension allows you to select text on any webpage, see the
translation, and hear the pronunciation in **American English** instead of the
default British accent.

## 🌐 About the Extension

Since in the official Google Translate extension we **can't change the accent
from British to American**, I made a solution for it!  
I've changed the default British accent to an **American accent**, so using this
extension, you can **easily listen to English words in American pronunciation**.
\
No more struggling with the default British voice :)

## 🧩 Download & Installation Guide

with American Accent** browser extension.
